## My process

At first I felt it would be a big challenge building my first responsive design, but for my surprise the development went smoothly.
Had to do a little reaser on flexbox and media queries, but after that in was able to apply it to the challenge with no problem.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this challenge I started learning the fundamentals on flexbox and responsive layouts.
Also it was my first time working with media queries.

### Continued development

Next steps will be getting solid knoledge in flexbox/grid to build the most effective layouts possible.
